With the significant increase in the amount of available data as well as the drastic improvement in computing power, Machine Learning has become one of the most popular topics in the industries and the academic world. Today, applications of Machine Learning can be fonud in nearly every field, and experts of many are also beginning dive deep into this interdisplinary topic. 

However, the design and implementation of Machine Learning algorithms can be tricky and complex, as they require the researchers to have strong knowledge in Mathematics, Statisics and Probabilities, in additional to their own expertise. 

Additionally, while using machine learning to characterize and analyze data, it is important to choose a model and parameters that would optimize the result. Applying different parameters may vary the model accuracy by 60% or more.

The objective of our product is to simplify the process of implementing and evaluating various Machine Learning models. We will use React to create a website, where users can upload their own datasets, choose the machine learning model(s) they want to work with, and configure the hyperparameters for the run. The website  will evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms, based on the input dataset.
